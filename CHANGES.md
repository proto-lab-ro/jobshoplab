# JobShopLab: Output Buffer Completion & Enhanced Transport System

## Major Changes Summary

This document summarizes the significant enhancements made to JobShopLab's job completion model and transport system.

### 🎯 Output Buffer Completion Model

**What Changed**: Jobs are now complete only when they reach designated output buffers, not just when operations finish.

**Why This Matters**: 
- More realistic manufacturing simulation
- Complete material flow modeling
- Better resource utilization analysis

**Migration Required**: 
- `is_done()` functions now require `instance` parameter
- Test fixtures need updates to place jobs at output buffers
- Instance configurations must include output buffers

### 🚛 Enhanced Transport Logic

**What Changed**: Intelligent routing system that makes context-aware decisions.

**Key Features**:
- Smart destination selection based on job completion status
- Unified transport handler logic  
- Enhanced transportability assessment

### ⏰ Time Dependency Resolution System

**What Changed**: New system handles complex scheduling scenarios where transports must wait.

**Benefits**:
- Respects buffer ordering constraints (FIFO/LIFO/FLEX)
- Prevents deadlocks
- Enables realistic coordination between transport resources

## API Changes Summary

### Breaking Changes
```python
# OLD: is_done(state) -> bool
# NEW: is_done(state, instance) -> bool

# OLD: get_next_idle_operation(job) -> OperationState  
# NEW: get_next_idle_operation(job) -> Optional[OperationState]
```

### New Functions
```python
def get_output_buffers(instance: InstanceConfig) -> tuple[BufferConfig, ...]
def is_transportable(job_state: JobState, state: State, instance: InstanceConfig) -> bool
def _time_dependency_is_resolved(transport: TransportState, state: State, instance: InstanceConfig) -> bool
```

## Configuration Changes Required

### Output Buffer Definition
```yaml
buffers:
  - id: "output-buffer"
    type: "flex_buffer" 
    capacity: 999999
    role: "output"  # Required for new completion model
```

### Transport Routes
```yaml
logistics:
  travel_times:
    # Routes from all machines to output buffers required
    ("machine-1", "output-buffer"): 5
    ("machine-2", "output-buffer"): 4
```
