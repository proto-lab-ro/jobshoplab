JobShopLab is a flexible and modular framework designed to advance research and development in job shop scheduling using Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques. It provides an adaptable gym environment, enabling users to test and benchmark different scheduling algorithms under realistic constraints found in industrial settings.

The GIF above showcases our framework in action, visualizing an automated production process where an RL agent dynamically assigns task to machines and vehicles. Colored blocks represent orders moving through different production stations, while AI makes real-time decisions to optimize order allocation and scheduling.


Features
------------

- **Modular Gym Environment**: A customizable and extensible framework for testing diverse scheduling strategies and problem specifications.
- **Reinforcement Learning Ready**: Seamless integration with RL algorithms via the standard Gym Interface.
- **Real-World Constraints**: Incorporates transport logistics, buffer management, machine breakdowns, setup times, and stochastic processing conditions.
- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Supports scheduling based on multiple objectives, such as makespan, energy efficiency, machine utilization, and lead time.
- **Output Buffer Completion Model**: New realistic job completion model requiring delivery to output buffers.
- **Enhanced Transport Logic**: Intelligent routing decisions with time dependency resolution for complex scenarios.
- **Pip Installable**: Easy installation from the repository, ensuring quick setup and integration into existing projects.

Installation
------------

To install JobShopLab, clone the repository and install it in editable mode using `pip`.

.. code-block:: bash

    cd <desired_dir>

    # ssh
    git clone git@github.com:proto-lab-ro/jobshoplab.git

    # or https
    git clone https://github.com/proto-lab-ro/jobshoplab.git
  # install python module in edible mode
    pip install -e <repo_dir>

Replace `<desired_dir>` with your target directory and `<repo_dir>` with the path to your local clone of the JobShopLab repository.

Getting Started
---------------

.. note::
   JobShopLab requires Python 3.12 or higher.

After installation, you can initialize and interact with JobShopLab in your Python scripts as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    from jobshoplab import JobShopLabEnv, load_config
    from pathlib import Path
    
    # Load a pre-defined configuration
    config = load_config(config_path=Path("./data/config/getting_started_config.yaml"))
    
    # Create the environment
    env = JobShopLabEnv(config=config)
    
    # Run with random actions until done
    done = False
    while not done:
        action = env.action_space.sample()
        obs, reward, truncated, terminated, info = env.step(action)
        done = truncated or terminated
    
    # Visualize the final schedule
    env.render()

We also provide a **Getting Started Jupyter Notebook** that walks you through the framework setup, environment interaction, and running basic reinforcement learning experiments. You can find this notebook in the repository under `jupyter/getting_started.ipynb`.

Framework Overview
-------------------

JobShopLab extends the classical Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) by integrating real-world production constraints and enabling RL-based optimization. It provides a state-machine-based simulation model that includes:

- **Machines**: Modeled with setup times, breakdowns, and stochastic processing.
- **Transport Units**: Handling job movements between machines with delays and constraints.
- **Buffers**: Limited storage capacity impacting scheduling decisions.

Experiments
-----------
To validate the framework, we trained an RL agent and compared its scheduling performance against traditional Priority Dispatch Rules (PDRs). Using the PPO algorithm from Stable Baselines3, the agent learned to optimize makespan efficiently. Compared to heuristic methods like Shortest Processing Time (SPT) and Most Work Remaining (MWKR), the RL-based approach achieves superior scheduling performance out of the box, in the standard academic cases and also with significantly increased complexity due to additional constraints such as buffer and transport constraints.
